The command I ran was 
"$ python csvcombine.py ./fixtures/accessories.csv ./fixtures/clothing.csv ./fixtures/household_cleaners.csv combine.csv"
A bit different than the one on github since I wasn't sure how to read the "> output" part.
Takes all files and uses the last file in args as output file.
